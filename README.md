In order to use the MarvelScreen you must register for an API key with develop.marvel.com.  This will give you a public and private key. Once you have these then you need to do the following.

Create a file called **apikey.properties** in the root folder of the project.
The body should look like this.

```
MARVEL_API_KEY="[Your public key provided by developer.marvel.com]"
MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY="[Your private key provided by developer.marvel.com]"
```
